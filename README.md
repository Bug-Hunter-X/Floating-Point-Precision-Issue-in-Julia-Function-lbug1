# Julia Floating-Point Precision Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug related to floating-point precision in a Julia function. The function `myfunction` is designed to square positive numbers and return 0 for non-positive numbers. However, due to floating-point limitations, it might produce unexpected results for values very close to zero.

## Bug Description

The issue arises when the input `x` is a floating-point number extremely close to zero but technically positive. Due to the way floating-point numbers are represented, the comparison `x > 0` might evaluate to `false` even when `x` is a very small positive number. This causes the function to return 0 instead of the expected small positive squared value.

## Solution

The solution involves using a tolerance value to account for floating-point inaccuracies.  We can compare the absolute value of `x` to a small tolerance instead of directly comparing `x` to 0.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.jl` to observe the unexpected behavior.
3. Run `bugSolution.jl` to see how the improved function handles this case effectively.
